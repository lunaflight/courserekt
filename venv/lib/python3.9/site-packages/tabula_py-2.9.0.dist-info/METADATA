`tabula-py` is a simple Python wrapper of [tabula-java](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java), which can read tables in a PDF.
You can read tables from a PDF and convert them into a pandas DataFrame. tabula-py also enables you to convert a PDF file into a CSV, a TSV or a JSON file.

You can see [the example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chezou/tabula-py/blob/master/examples/tabula_example.ipynb) and try it on Google Colab, or we highly recommend reading [our documentation](https://tabula-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), especially the FAQ section.

![tabula-py example](https://github.com/chezou/tabula-py/raw/master/example.png)

## Requirements

- Java 8+
- Python 3.8+

### OS

I confirmed working on macOS and Ubuntu. But some people confirm it works on Windows 10. See also [the documentation for the detailed installation for Windows 10](https://tabula-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#get-tabula-py-working-windows-10).

## Usage

- [Documentation](https://tabula-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - [FAQ](https://tabula-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html) would be helpful if you have an issue
- [Example notebook on Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/chezou/tabula-py/blob/master/examples/tabula_example.ipynb)

### Install

Ensure you have a Java runtime and set the PATH for it.

```bash
pip install tabula-py
```

If you want to leverage faster execution with jpype, install with `jpype` extra.

```sh
pip install tabula-py[jpype]
```

### Example

tabula-py enables you to extract tables from a PDF into a DataFrame, or a JSON. It can also extract tables from a PDF and save the file as a CSV, a TSV, or a JSON.  

```py
import tabula

# Read pdf into list of DataFrame
dfs = tabula.read_pdf("test.pdf", pages='all')

# Read remote pdf into list of DataFrame
dfs2 = tabula.read_pdf("https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java/raw/master/src/test/resources/technology/tabula/arabic.pdf")

# convert PDF into CSV file
tabula.convert_into("test.pdf", "output.csv", output_format="csv", pages='all')

# convert all PDFs in a directory
tabula.convert_into_by_batch("input_directory", output_format='csv', pages='all')
```

See [an example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chezou/tabula-py/blob/master/examples/tabula_example.ipynb) for more details. I also recommend reading [the tutorial article](https://aegis4048.github.io/parse-pdf-files-while-retaining-structure-with-tabula-py) written by [@aegis4048](https://github.com/aegis4048), and [another tutorial](https://www.dunderdata.com/blog/read-trapped-tables-within-pdfs-as-pandas-dataframes) written by [@tdpetrou](https://github.com/tdpetrou).
